# Remembering HTML

A minimal and focused project dedicated to revisiting **HTML fundamentals**. This repository is intentionally simple and avoids modern frameworks or complex tooling in order to concentrate on the core structure of the web.

The project serves as a personal exercise to refresh foundational knowledge, reinforce best practices, and better understand how web pages function at a basic level.
